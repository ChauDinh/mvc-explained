# What is MVC?

* What is the M in MVC?

* What is the V in MVC?

* What is the C in MVC?

## Notes

M stands for Model and it represents the data structure you config and save a name representing a entiny in your system.

V stands for View and it represents what you will send to the client making a request to your server.

C stands for Controller and it represents logics (usually wrapped in functions) that will handle the incoming network requests and then return to the client.

The flow usually goes:

client (browser) --> controller --> model --> view --> client (browser)
